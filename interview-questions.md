# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

I wrote all this below in the example, then saw it was an example. 
there was nothing there, so i guess i just did an extra question. 
which just helps me so im happy about it for practice im leaving it for myself

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: A conditional statement is a list of computer command instuctions, that require something to happen for the code to take action. They use if or else statements to input data text strings or numeric values. This requires the code to act on a contition put in by the programmer to get a specific result.

  Researched answer: Decision structures, also called decision trees, conditional statements, or if/else statements, are fundamental to computer programming. Conditional statements are a sequence of well-defined instructions that produce a unique output based on the value of the input. Conditionals follow a flowchart-like structure and allow you create logic in your code.



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a command that allows you to connect, create branches, make changes,pull files, and publish work. This command works with Github from the terminal taking files from local to online. Github is a file sharing website where developers share code and work together on projects it can also work as reasume with a catalog of all your work. 

  Researched answer: git is a command used in the terminal, to communicate with Github. Github is a free file sharing website that you can use to work on large projects as a group. Both are known for being highly annoying at times. When you may not under stand what needs to be done or how to do it.




2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: 
  true and false

  Researched answer: 
  Boolean expressions in JavaScript return true or false. 
  Even though true and false are words they are not strings. They represent the value of true/false.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: A value is any type of data text or numeric. An index is the place a value takes in an array. The diffrence is an index is a numbaric place and whole of data working together. where as a value is just the data in that place being called on.

  Researched answer: 
  index: a common method for keeping track of data so that it can be accessed quickly. Like an index in a book, it is a list in which each entry contains the name of the item and its location. 
  
  value: In mathematics, logic, and computer programming, a value is a definite object. For example, the number 1, the letter a, and the unique combination of letters that forms the word apple are all values. In a computers, a value is usually a number, a single character, or a string of characters.

  the difference: Element 0 is at index 0. "Index" describes the storage location. "Element" describes the contents of a location. "Value" describes the content of an element.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: an iteration is a code instructions that keep going until its told to stop or gets the desired result

  Researched answer: Iteration is the process of executing a block of code over and over again until a condition is met.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming techniques, means someone is always a driver or a navigator. This involves the navigator watching for errors in the code. The navigator should also, have related topics open to the problem at hand. This helps the driver and navigator accomplish their goal together as a team. The driver should be writing code and assessing the problem at hand as they go. Drivers should also follow the navigators instruction. As well as share their screen, so navigators can watch for errors and assist with the code creation and debugging.Teams of drivers and navigators should switch off. This assists in problem solving, brings a fresh look at the code when you may be stuggling,and helps with possible unseen errors. My personal pair programming technique is knowing when to say, your unsure how to start or get the desired result you are looking for. Allowing you to gain understanding of your partners ideas on a possible solution, their knowledge which you may not have, and create a solution together.Which you may have not come up with on your own. Rather than one person coding and the other just watching for errors and possibly never coming to a solution.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is a strategy used in development. It uses two people to check for errors while another writes code. This is highly effective in getting massive projects finished fast. Proper pair programming, requires good communication and an ability to step back from the problem at hand to look at in a diffrent light.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher-order functions are built in methods in JavaScript that act on arrays. They are a specific subset of built in methods that take a function as an argument.

2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. Jest was created by Facebook and used by Twitter, Spotify, and Airbnb

3. Objects: Objects are a datatype that contain collections of key:value pairs. Objects are the cross section of data (static information) and behavior (methods)

4. Method: When a funtion belongs to an object

5. Classes: Classes are the blueprint for objects. Classes are reusable and customizable, much like functions
